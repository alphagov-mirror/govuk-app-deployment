# Not using braces around hashes makes the capistrano DSL look a bit odd, when
# using hashes with strings as the second argument. For example, this is better

# set :config_files_to_upload, {
#   "to_upload/redis.yml" => "config/redis.yml",

# It's complaining about `recipes` files. These are deployment files
